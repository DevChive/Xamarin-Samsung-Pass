# Xamarin-Samsung-Pass
Xamarin binding project for the Samsung Pass API

Xamarin binding for Samsung Pass API with via JNI. Regular Xamarin Android Bindings did not work for this one, so I have done them manually. The functionality offered is the same as the Java API, with some C#-isms (http://img-developer.samsung.com/onlinedocs/sms/pass/index.html).

Binding is currently against Samsung Pass SDK 1.1.3 and tested against Samsung Galaxy S5.

Example usage to follow shortly in the SamsungPass.Android project.
