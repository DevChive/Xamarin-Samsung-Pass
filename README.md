# Xamarin-Samsung-Pass
Xamarin binding project for the Samsung Pass API

Xamarin binding for Samsung Pass API with via JNI. The functionality offered is the same as the Java API, with some C#-isms applied throughout (http://img-developer.samsung.com/onlinedocs/sms/pass/index.html).

Binding is currently against Samsung Pass SDK 1.1.3 and tested against Samsung Galaxy S5.

The SamsungPass.Android project shows the sample usage for this API and mimics the example provided in the Samsung Pass API sample project.

Improvements/suggestions for this binding are most welcome.
